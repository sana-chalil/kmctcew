            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                With 2021 well behind us, COVID-19’s presence still continues to linger around the world. Of all the industries that have been been changed by the aftermath of this pandemic, healthcare arguably has changed the most. With appreciable advances in technology and methods necessary to support the increasing demand of access to healthcare and growing digitization of protected health information, the healthcare industry has developed in diverse ways for meeting our needs.
                As we continue ahead, it’s is critical to be aware of the trends driving this sector in the future. Although legacy software and infrastructure is inevitable to the success of modern hospitals and care centers, it’s paramount that we acknowledge how those systems can incorporate the newer technologies. The focus should be on improving performance, productivity, efficiency, and security without sacrificing reliability or accessibility. Also, with increasing health problems and diagnosis, large data is available for analysis. The need for intelligent systems to handle, sort, analyze, predict the condition and suggest an appropriate treatment plan is on the rise. This emerging field is a result of contribution from various technologies pertaining to image processing, signal processing, computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, IoT, etc. Bringing together academicians and industry personnel working on these aspects and to find ways of improving the existing techniques is very important to leverage its potential. With this as the focus, IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES. This conference aims at bringing together experts to showcase their contribution and opportunities for evolution in the research work for improved outcomes
